# My First Version Website - GitHub Pages & Jekyll (Moonrise Theme)

This is the first version of my personal website, created using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and the Moonrise theme. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my projects, social links, and documentation. Built with the help of VS Code, Ruby, and AI, this version will no longer be updated but remains a reflection of my early work. Feel free to explore and browse through my creations!
